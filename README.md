Wine Quality Prediction Project Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction Project is designed to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical attributes. Utilizing a machine learning model, this project aims to provide users with an intuitive interface to input wine characteristics and receive a quality assessment.

Features

Predict wine quality based on user-inputted parameters. Intuitive web interface for easy interaction. Backend API for processing and predicting wine quality. Data validation to ensure accurate input and results.

Technologies Used:-

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: (Specify if any, e.g., Heroku, AWS) Getting Started

Clone the repository: bash Copy code:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/wine-quality-prediction.git

Install dependencies: Copy code
